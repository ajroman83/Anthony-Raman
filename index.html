    Hello and welcome! I appreciate you stopping by my personal page. While this page details my professional experiences, here's a little bit about Anthony,
    the person outside of the workplace.<br>
    <br>
    I love spending time with family and friends. Get togethers are my absolute favorite and I love creating great memories with those that I love. I have a beautiful fiance and an amazing dog who make up my little family.
    I love sports, grew up playing basketall and football and I enjoy anything outdoors. I'd say late summer into fall is my favorite time of year. My hobbies include making my own beer. And while I'm still working on that million dollar recipe I do
    enjoy the science behind brewing beer and of course, the end results. It's fun to bring my own beer to the aformentioned
    get togethers and share with others. I also love learning about real estate and working towards my goals in real estate investing. Lastly, I can't forget to mention coding and my growing passion for web development which has led me to take many
    online classes and
    pursue a full-stack web development bootcamp. What can I say, I have a love for technology and desire to constantly be learning.
